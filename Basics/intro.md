for now, I have things split up in 4 different modules. Modules consist of lectures, tutorials, and labs.
- lectures will be focused on theory, while tutorials will be more focused on how to apply the theory and give you the necessary tools to do so.
- use the labs to check and make sure you are able to apply the knowledge you gain through the lectures and tutorials.

im calling them lectures and labs but in reality they are just text files lol. ill have the associated videos at the top of each doc as i populate them.
id reccomend not moving onto the next module if you are stuggling to complete the associated labs of the previous module. Each module builds ontop of the next.
 
Ill have answers to each lab also there, so if you are struggling, take a look. THIS SHOULD BE YOUR LAST OPTION.
before you look at the answers, use chatgpt, ask someone who knows what they are doing, do something. you are meant to be learning.
This is not school, where the onl real outcome you have is your grade. any knowledge at this phase should be rock solid, and any cracks in this foundation will start
showing through as you start working on cool shit.

 If I'm being honest this basics folder is almost entirely the reason why this repo was created. Getting these foundational skills right will pay off exponentially as you continue.
