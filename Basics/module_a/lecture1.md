this lecutre is a typical one for the starting of a course, goes over cool things you'd be learning, and how the next little bit would be structured. this md file is lower on the priority to populate.
I honestly like the lectures, the profs are pretty good. If you have the time, I would definetly reccomend watching all of them alongside these md files.
