# knowledgebase
documenting everything an involved member would need to know. the goal with this repo is to take any motivated student(regardless of skill level) and turn them into a cracked individual, almost like a lesson plan. 

base of the repo(chances are i wont have the base done until the end of may, 2025) is based on https://roboracer.ai/learn

there are lots of videos there as well, so if you want to watch through lectures and tutorials, use it to supplement what you go through here as this will quickly outgrow the course at roboracer.

when i come back to this readme(probably wont happen until july or so)ill provide an overview of the contents. for now, take what another one of our founding members had to say when he first started

```
as  a Computer Systems Engineering student, I can see a potential career path and I want to learn more about developing an autonomous vehicle. Therefore, after researching, I want to participate in the F1Tenth competition for students this incoming May. After talks with the Faculty professors and the Dean, they fully support this initiation and want to start a club/student association related to this topic.

This project involves feature deployment on Open Source project:

Working Python and C++ code in Linux environment and performing project Continuous Deployment practices using Docker Compose.
Implementing Lidar sensor algorithms and features on an open-source framework.
Applying Machine Learning to perform a racing track prediction.
```
